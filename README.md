ðŸ§  ContourIQ

Smart Shape Analysis from Segmented Images

ContourIQ is a modular, AI-assisted pipeline that analyzes object contours from segmented images to extract meaningful insights â€” including object type classification (e.g. man-made vs. natural) and structural features like fractures, shape complexity, and geometry. Built for flexibility, precision, and scalability.
