# ðŸ§  ContourIQ

Smart Shape Analysis from Segmented Images

ContourIQ is a modular, AI-assisted pipeline that analyzes object contours from segmented images to extract meaningful insights â€” including object type classification (e.g. man-made vs. natural) and structural features like fractures, shape complexity, and geometry. Built for flexibility, precision, and scalability.


# ContourIQ: Key Contour Features Explained

ContourIQ uses a variety of scientifically grounded shape features to classify and understand object contours extracted from segmented images. Here's a breakdown of the key features and why each matters in real-world object classification.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Area
- **Definition:** Total number of pixels inside the contour.
- **Why it matters:** Provides object size. Very small areas might be noise; large ones are typically full objects.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Perimeter
- **Definition:** Total length of the contour's boundary.
- **Why it matters:** Used alongside area to assess shape smoothness. Jagged or complex shapes have longer perimeters.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Circularity
- **Formula:** \( \frac{4 \cdot \pi \cdot \text{Area}}{\text{Perimeter}^2} \)
- **Range:** [0, 1], with 1 representing a perfect circle.
- **Why it matters:** Distinguishes round objects (e.g., wheels, balls) from angular or irregular ones.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Aspect Ratio
- **Formula:** Width / Height of the bounding box.
- **Why it matters:** High ratios indicate elongated objects like sticks or rods.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Extent
- **Formula:** \( \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Bounding Box Area}} \)
- **Why it matters:** Indicates how fully the object occupies its bounding box. Low extent often points to sparse or odd shapes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Solidity
- **Formula:** \( \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Convex Hull Area}} \)
- **Why it matters:** Measures convexity. Lower values suggest more indentations or hollow regionsâ€”useful for detecting fractures.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Eccentricity
- **Formula:** \( \sqrt{1 - (b/a)^2} \) where \( a = \) major axis and \( b = \) minor axis
- **Range:** 0 (circle) to 1 (line)
- **Why it matters:** High eccentricity values indicate very elongated objectsâ€”like pipes or beams.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Skeleton Length
- **Definition:** Total number of pixels in the skeletonized version of the object.
- **Why it matters:** A proxy for shape complexity or length. Long skeletons are characteristic of wires, cords, or branches.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Hu Moments (1â€“7)
- **Definition:** A set of seven invariant shape descriptors.
- **Why it matters:** Remain stable under scaling, translation, and rotationâ€”ideal for comparing and matching complex shapes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Convexity Defects
- **Definition:** Points where the contour deviates inward from its convex hull.
- **Why it matters:** More defects suggest irregular or broken surfacesâ€”important for fracture detection.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 11. Number of Corners
- **Definition:** Number of points in a simplified polygonal contour.
- **Why it matters:** Helps distinguish regular (e.g., square) from irregular or organic shapes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 12. Fourier Descriptor (First Harmonic Magnitude)
- **Definition:** Strength of the first frequency component in the Fourier transform of the contour.
- **Why it matters:** A low magnitude typically indicates a regular, smooth outline. High values imply jagged or noisy shapes.

These features form the foundation of ContourIQ's shape intelligence pipeline, powering object classification from raw segmentation data with precision and interpretability.
